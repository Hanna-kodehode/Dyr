          <div class="text-background">
            <p>
              Capybaras are the adorable giants of the rodent world, known for
              their gentle personalities and social nature. Native to South
              America's wetlands and forests, they’re the largest rodents alive,
              growing up to 4 feet long and weighing as much as 150 pounds.
              These animals are semi-aquatic, perfectly adapted for life near
              water, with webbed toes and high-set eyes and noses that let them
              swim while keeping an eye out for danger. Capybaras love to swim
              and can often be found lounging or cooling off in rivers and
              ponds, where they feel safest.
            </p>

            <p>
              These animals are incredibly social and live in groups of 10 to
              100, often looking after one another’s young and forming bonds
              that are surprisingly strong for rodents. When relaxed, capybaras
              often engage in behaviors like grooming each other, which further
              strengthens their social ties and fosters a sense of
              communityTheir friendly nature extends to other animals, too,
              making them easy companions for everything from birds to monkeys
              (who famously hitch rides on their backs).
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to their social nature, capybaras play a crucial role
              in their ecosystems. As grazers, they help maintain the balance of
              their habitats by controlling the growth of vegetation. This, in
              turn, supports the diverse range of species that depend on these
              wetlands for survival. Moreover, their presence often attracts
              predators, which helps to regulate the populations of other
              animals in the area. By fostering biodiversity, capybaras
              contribute to the health and stability of their environments,
              showcasing the interconnectedness of all living creatures.
            </p>

            <p>
              As herbivores, capybaras snack on grasses, aquatic plants, and
              fruit, and they have a unique way of digesting their food twice to
              get extra nutrients. Their calm and easygoing temperament has
              earned them the nickname "nature’s chillest animal," and they’ve
              become internet favorites for their endearing, peaceful demeanor
              and sweet little smiles.
